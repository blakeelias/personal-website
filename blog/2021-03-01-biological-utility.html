    <h1>Intrinsic Reward, Biological Utility, and Saving the Planet</h1>

    <p>
      I have long believed that the best things to do are the things that drive you internally.

      My overall takeaway is that we need to replace the concept of utility with something more biological. It seems like a more satisfying and realistic model.

      And perhaps also a way to fix what's wrong with our economy, eg. why it doesn't seem to understand climate change yet.

    <p>
      An economy that ignores climate may maximize some imaginary "utility", but will ultimately destroy the biological building blocks it rests upon, and get selected out by evolution. Only with a biologically-grounded utility function will these two processes align (rational choice and evolution). So, this seems like the type of thing that's fundamental both for conceiving better AI agents, as well as for saving the planet.
