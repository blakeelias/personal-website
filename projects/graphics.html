    <h2>Computer Graphics: 3D Rendering and Animation Engine</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some images and animations produced by my final project from Stuyvesant's computer graphics class.   I built a 3D graphics rendering and animation engine from the ground up, including line drawing, parametric curve generation and Bezier curves, lighting and flat shading, and motion description language for animation.

    <p>The C source code is <a href="https://github.com/blakeelias/graphics/tree/main/ml6-d-svn/trunk/final/Mendelias">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
