    <h2>Zero Robotics on the International Space Station</h2>
    <p>In the fall of 2010, I started and led a team that competed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709195558/http://zerorobotics.org/">Zero Robotics</a> competition.  

      <blockquote>Zero Robotics is a student competition that takes "arena robotics" to new heights, literally. The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES and the final competition of every tournament is aboard the International Space Station!</blockquote>

    <p>Our code is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709195558/https://github.com/blakeelias/Stuy-Naught-2010">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>Both the 2010 and 2011 competitions were focused on alternative energy sources.  In the 2010 competition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709195558/http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/index.php/past-competitions/zr-2010/zr-2010-challenge-statement">HelioSPHERES</a>, we programmed a satellite to automatically repair a virtual solar power station.  In the 2011 competition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709195558/http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/manuals/AsteroSPHERES_Manual.pdf">AsteroSPHERES</a>, we are programming a satellite to extract Helium-3 (a promising isotope to be used as a nuclear energy source), from two virtual asteroids.</p>

    <p>Before deploying to the space station, we rigorously tested the satellite's behavior in MIT's MATLAB-based simulator: </p>
